    <h1>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 19, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Service Level Agreement (SLA) establishes the commitment of CPTCR Hosting ("Company") to provide reliable and consistent hosting services to our clients ("Customer"). This SLA defines uptime guarantees, compensation policies, support response times, and exclusions. By using our services, the Customer acknowledges and agrees to the terms outlined in this agreement.</p>

    <h2>2. Service Availability</h2>
    <p>CPTCR Hosting guarantees an uptime of <strong>99.50%</strong> per calendar month. This uptime percentage is calculated based on the total number of minutes in a given month, excluding maintenance windows.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Scheduled Maintenance</h3>
    <p>Scheduled maintenance is an essential part of ensuring the security and stability of our infrastructure. CPTCR Hosting reserves the right to perform maintenance operations that may temporarily disrupt services. Customers will be notified at least 24 hours before any scheduled maintenance is conducted.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Emergency Maintenance</h3>
    <p>In the case of urgent updates or vulnerabilities that require immediate attention, CPTCR Hosting may conduct emergency maintenance without prior notice. While we will strive to notify customers as soon as possible, service disruptions during emergency maintenance will not count against the uptime guarantee.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Excluded Downtime</h3>
    <p>The following events are considered exclusions from uptime calculations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Planned maintenance, announced at least 24 hours in advance.</li>
        <li>Emergency maintenance required to mitigate security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Issues caused by Customer-side misconfigurations or software installations.</li>
        <li>Network outages beyond CPTCR Hostingâ€™s control, including upstream provider failures.</li>
        <li>Force majeure events such as natural disasters, war, or government regulations.</li>
        <li>Hardware failures that occur despite proper maintenance and redundancy measures.</li>
        <li>Traffic spikes caused by external malicious attacks such as DDoS attempts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Compensation Policy</h2>
    <p>If CPTCR Hosting fails to meet the guaranteed uptime threshold of 99.50%, customers may request service credits. Service credits will be applied as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>99.49% - 98.50% uptime: 3% service credit</li>
        <li>98.49% - 97.00% uptime: 7% service credit</li>
        <li>Below 97.00% uptime: 15% service credit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Requests for service credits must be submitted in writing within 14 days of the incident. Service credits are not refundable for cash and may only be applied to future invoices.</p>
